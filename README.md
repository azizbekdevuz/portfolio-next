# 🌟 My Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio site where I showcase my work, skills, and cool projects. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Three.js**, it has smooth animations, interactive 3D elements, and a clean, modern look.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **✨ Next.js & TypeScript** – because I love clean and scalable code
- **🎭 Framer Motion** – smooth animations, because static is boring
- **🌌 Three.js & @react-three/fiber** – a little bit of 3D magic
- **🗄️ MongoDB Atlas** - database driven approach to load datasets dynamically
- **📱 Fully responsive** – looks great on all screens
- **⚡ Optimized for performance** – because speed matters

## 🛠️ Get It Running Locally

Wanna play around with it? Here’s how:

### 1️⃣ Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/azizbekdevuz/portfolio-next.git
cd portfolio-next
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

| File          | Action                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| `.env.example` | **Rename** to `.env.local` |
| `.env.local`  | **Update only the values**, but do not change key names |

📌 **Important:** The database settings are now component-based, meaning the page renders and displays data dynamically from MongoDB.

To rename the file in a terminal:
```sh
mv .env.example .env.local
```

### 4️⃣ Start the dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and explore!

## 🏗️ Build for Production

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```
