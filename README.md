# 🌟 My Portfolio Website  

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio site where I showcase my work, skills, and cool projects. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Three.js**, it has smooth animations, interactive 3D elements, and a clean, modern look.  

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  
- **✨ Next.js & TypeScript** – because I love clean and scalable code  
- **🎭 Framer Motion** – smooth animations, because static is boring  
- **🌌 Three.js & @react-three/fiber** – a little bit of 3D magic  
- **📱 Fully responsive** – looks great on all screens  
- **⚡ Optimized for performance** – because speed matters
